# LeagueHub

This project is a unique one to express my passion in football and the premier league, one of my first ones that Im very proud of.

On all the sites and apps I visit for football, none of them have the standings, the upcoming fixtures for your favourite team, and the next gameweek all on one screen, so I think that annoyance is alleviated with this website. At least it was a personal one.

Because of API limitations, the website only shows the Premier League standings on the left, and the current PL gameweek on the right.
If the game is scheduled, a time will be shown, if it is live, a corresponding indicator will appear, the same goes for half time and once it
is full time, the scores will be displayed.

If a team is clicked on the standings table on the left, the website will update the middle column to reflect the upcoming fixtures in the premier league
for the team you chose.
Originally, I wanted to show ALL the games for the team, including the domestic cup competitions but I was restricted to only the premier league by the API. (I didn't want to pay)
Fortunately they allow Champions League fixtures as a bonus, the link to the api is visible at the top right of the website.
